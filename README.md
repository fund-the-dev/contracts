# Fund The Dev Contracts

This repo contains the source code for all the ethereum smart contracts used by fundthe.dev.

## Getting Started

We use truffle to build and test our smart contracts, so you'll need node to install this toolchain.

```
$ npm i -g truffle
$ truffle build
```

## Contributing
